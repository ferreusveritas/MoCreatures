Mo' Creatures is a mod created by DrZhark. It was created on November 17, 2010. A mod which adds over 40 new mobs to your game, it provides many new animal and monster mobs, as well as the ability to tame and ride some.

This is a non-official, heavily modified and stripped version for a private modpack.  Original source code for Mo' Creatures is licensed as GPL-3.0 so modifying the original codebase is explicitly permitted.

This fork version removes a bunch of silly features and attempts to fix spawning and AI wherever possible.  It also contains references to mods that I use and does so in a not-at-all careful way because as stated before, this is for a private modpack.
